======================
Cassandra Bloom Filter
======================

Basically this is what `Alex Cruise <https://github.com/acruise>`_ `did <https://github.com/acruise/cassandra-bloom-filter>`_ but more up to date (for now...I'm sure it'll eventually fall out of date).

This is a simpleminded extraction and Mavenization of the `Bloom Filter <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter>`_ code from `Apache Cassandra <http://incubator.apache.org/cassandra/>`_.

It's released under the Apache 2.0 license.

The project has been Mavenized and the tests should run (but don't).
